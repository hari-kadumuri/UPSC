Order of a PDE:
    The order of a PDE is the order of the highest order derivative in the PDE .

Degree of a PDE:
    The degree of the highest order derivative involving in the PDE is called the degree of PDE.

Solving strategy for any PDE:
    1. Eqns solvable by direct integration
    2. PDE of order 1 (different from Linear PDE. very important difference)
        2.1 Linear Eqn/ Semi Linear Eqn/ Quasi-Linear Eqn having two independent variables
            Form a Lagranges Auxiliary Eqn (LAE) from the given PDE.
            Methods to solve LAE:
                Method 1:
                    Solvable by variable seperation.
                Method 2:
                    1 of the Eqn is solvable by variable seperation.
                    Use the above eqn in the other eqn to solve it.
                Method 3:
                    Using multipliers.
        2.2 Linear Eqn containing more than two independent variables
            Same strategy as above. But there will be generalisation interms of independent variables.
    3. Linear PDE with constant coefficients:
        3.1 Homogeneous Linear PDE with constant coefficients
            3.1.1 Finding Complementary Function (CF)
                Form a polynomical interms of D, D' where D = partial derivate wrt x and D' = partial derivative wrt y
                Now form Auxiliary Eqn (AE) by putting D = m and D' = 1.
                Find roots of the AE.
                Let the roots be m1, m1, m2
                Then CF will be Φ1(y+m1x) + x*Φ2(y+m1x) + Φ3(y+m2x)
                -> Special cases:
                    1. Corresponding to a non repeated factor of D on RHS, we place Φ(y) in the CF.
                    2. Corresponding to a repeated factor of D on RHS like D^2, we place Φ1(y)+xΦ2(y) in the CF.
                    3. Corresponding to a non repeated factor of D' on RHS, we place Φ(x) in the CF.
                    4. Corresponding to a repeated factor of D' on RHS like D'^2, we place Φ1(x)+yΦ2(x) in the CF.
            3.1.2 Finding Particular Integral (PI)

        3.2 Non Homogeneous Linear PDE with constant coefficients
            3.2.1 Finding Complementary Function (CF)
                Here we follow almost same strategy as above
                For every factor (D-mD'-K), we put e^(Kx)Φ(y+mx)
                If the roots are repeating:
                    For example (D-mD'-K)(D-mD'-K)
                    we put e^(Kx)[Φ1(y+mx) + Φ2(y+mx)]
                -> Special cases:
                    Same as above
            3.2.2 When Linear factors are not possible
                Here we put a trial soln and hope it works.
                Usually try with Ae^(hx+ky).
            3.2.3 Finding Particular Integral (PI)
        3.3 Eqns reducible to Linear Form with constant coefficients by using suitable substitutions
            Here sir only told eqns which can be solved using cauchy substitutions
            i.e. putting x = e^X and y = e^Y.
        3.4 Second Order PDEs with variable coefficients
            Solving Methods:
            Method 1: Direct integration
                Keep integrating until all the no more derivatives are present
            Method 2: Reducing to Canonical Form by transforming independent variables
            Eqns of the Form Rr + Ss + Tt + f(x, y, z, p, q) = 0
                Here we solve these type of eqns by reducing the given eqn into canonical form by changing independent variables from x, y to u, v
                Here R(λ^2) + Sλ + T = 0 is Characteristic Eqn (CE).
                Let the roots of CE are λ1, λ2
                Case 1: if the roots are real and distinct
                    Then new independent variables are u, v such that
                    u, v are the solutions are the eqns
                            dy/dx + λ1 = 0 and
                            dy/dx + λ2 = 0 respectively
                Case 2: if the roots are real and equal
                    Then u is the soln of  dy/dx + λ1 = 0
                    Now for choosing v, we can select any function such that Jacobian((u, v)/(x, y)) ≠ 0.
                    Follow the below steps to choose v in a better way:
                        1.
                Case 3: if the roots are imaginary
                    Here choose u, v same as in case 1.
                    Say u = α + iβ
                    Therefore v = α - iβ
                    instead of choosing u, v as new independent variables, here we choose α, β as new independent variables.
                After choosing independent variables, convert the given eqn into new independent varibles.
                The eqn will be changed to canonical form which can be solved using Direct Integration.

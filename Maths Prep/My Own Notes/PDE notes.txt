Order of a PDE:
    The order of a PDE is the order of the highest order derivative in the PDE.

Degree of a PDE:
    The degree of the highest order derivative involving in the PDE is called the degree of PDE.

Notation:
    p = first order partial derivative of z wrt x
    q = first order partial derivative of z wrt y
    r = second order partial derivative of z wrt only x
    s = second order partial derivative of z wrt both x and y
    t = second order partial derivative of z wrt only y

Solving strategy for any PDE:
    1. Eqns solvable by direct integration
    2. PDE of order 1 (different from Linear PDE. very important difference)
        2.1 Linear Eqn/ Semi Linear Eqn/ Quasi-Linear Eqn having two independent variables
            Linear Eqn: P(x, y)p + Q(x, y)q = R(x, y) + zS(x, y)
            Semi Linear Eqn: P(x, y)p + Q(x, y)q = R(x, y, z)
            Quasi Linear Eqn: P(x, y, z)p + Q(x, y, z)q = R(x, y, z)
            
            All the above forms of eqns can be solved by forming Lagranges Auxiliary Eqn (LAE) which is as follows.
                    dx/P = dy/Q = dz/R
            Methods to solve LAE:
                Method 1:
                    Solvable by variable seperation.
                Method 2:
                    1 of the Eqn is solvable by variable seperation.
                    Use the above eqn in the other eqn to solve it.
                Method 3:
                    Using multipliers.
        2.2 Linear Eqn containing more than two independent variables
            Same strategy as above. But there will be generalisation interms of independent variables.
    3. Linear PDE with constant coefficients:
        3.1 Homogeneous Linear PDE with constant coefficients
            3.1.1 Finding Complementary Function (CF)
                Form a polynomial interms of D, D' where D = partial derivate wrt x and D' = partial derivative wrt y
                Now form Auxiliary Eqn (AE) by putting D = m and D' = 1.
                Find roots of the AE.
                Let the roots be m1, m1, m2
                Then CF will be Φ1(y+m1x) + x*Φ2(y+m1x) + Φ3(y+m2x)
                -> Special cases:
                    1. Corresponding to a non repeated factor of D on RHS, we place Φ(y) in the CF.
                    2. Corresponding to a repeated factor of D on RHS like D^2, we place Φ1(y)+xΦ2(y) in the CF.
                    3. Corresponding to a non repeated factor of D' on RHS, we place Φ(x) in the CF.
                    4. Corresponding to a repeated factor of D' on RHS like D'^2, we place Φ1(x)+yΦ2(x) in the CF.
            3.1.2 Finding Particular Integral (PI)
                consider the eqn F(D, D')z = f(x, y) and
                let the degree of F(D, D') be n
                case 1: if f(x, y) = Φ(ax+by)
                    case a: if F(a, b) ≠ 0
                        then PI = (1/F(a, b)) * ∫∫∫∫.........∫Φ(v)dvdv.........dv where v = ax+by
                        Note that the number of integrations in the above formula is n which is the degree of the F(D, D')
                    case b: if F(a, b) = 0
                        let F(a, b) = (bD-aD')^m
                        then PI = [(x^m)/((b^m)m!)]Φ(ax+by)
                case 2: if f(x, y) is polynomial. let the highest term be (x^m*y^n)
                    expand 1/F(D, D') using binomial expansion in the following way:
                    case a: if n < m
                        expand in powers of D'/D
                    case b: if n > m
                        expand in powers of D/D'
                case 3: general method to find PI
                    After factorizing F(D, D') into the terms (D-mD'), we use following formula:
                        Φ(x, y)/(D-mD') = ∫Φ(x, a-mx)dx where a = y+mx
                        After integration, replace a with y+mx
                        Repeat the same step for all the factors of F(D, D') until no more are left
        3.2 Non Homogeneous Linear PDE with constant coefficients
            3.2.1 Finding Complementary Function (CF)
                Here we follow a similar strategy as above
                For every factor (D-mD'-K), we put e^(Kx)Φ(y+mx)
                If the roots are repeating:
                    For example (D-mD'-K)(D-mD'-K)
                    we put e^(Kx)[Φ1(y+mx) + x*Φ2(y+mx)]
                -> Special cases:
                    Same as in the case of finding CF for Homogeneous Linear PDE with constant coefficients
            3.2.2 Finding Particular Integral (PI)
                consider the eqn F(D, D')z = f(x, y) and
                let the degree of F(D, D') be n
                case 1: f(x, y) = e^(ax+by) and F(a, b) ≠ 0
                    PI = (e^(ax+by))/F(a, b)
                case 2: if F(a, b) = 0
                    follow the same strategy as in the case of finding PI in Homogeneous Linear PDE
                case 3: if f(x, y) = sin(ax+by) or cos(ax+by)
                    put D^2 = -a^2 and D'^2 = -b^2 and DD' = -ab
                case 4: if f(x, y) = (x^m*y^n)
                    expand [F(D, D')]^(-1) in the powers of D, D'.
                    Follow the same strategy as followed incase of finding PI in Homogeneous Linear PDE
                case 5: f(x, y) = [e^(ax+by)]*V(x, y)
                    PI = [e^(ax+by)][(1/F(D+a, D'+b))V(x, y)]
            3.2.3 When Linear factors are not possible
                Here we put a trial soln and hope it works.
                Initially try with X(x)Y(y) as trial soln.
                If the above one does not work then put try with Ae^(hx+ky).
    4 Linear PDE with variable coefficients
        4.1 Eqns reducible to Linear Form with constant coefficients by using suitable substitutions
            Here sir only told eqns which can be solved using cauchy substitutions
            i.e. putting x = e^X and y = e^Y.
        4.2 Second Order PDE with variable coefficients
            Solving Methods:
            Method 1: Direct integration
                Keep integrating until no more derivatives are present
            Method 2: Reducing to Canonical Form by transforming independent variables
                Eqns of the Form Rr + Ss + Tt + f(x, y, z, p, q) = 0
                Here we solve these type of eqns by reducing the given eqn into canonical form by changing independent variables from x, y to u, v
                Here R(λ^2) + Sλ + T = 0 is Characteristic Eqn (CE).
                Let the roots of CE are λ1, λ2
                Case 1: if the roots are real and distinct
                    Then new independent variables are u, v such that
                    u, v are the solutions are the eqns
                            dy/dx + λ1 = 0 and
                            dy/dx + λ2 = 0 respectively
                Case 2: if the roots are real and equal
                    Then u is the soln of  dy/dx + λ1 = 0
                    Now for choosing v, we can select any function such that Jacobian((u, v)/(x, y)) ≠ 0.
                    Follow the below steps to choose v in a better way:
                        1. Choose v similar to u so that calculation becomes easier
                        2. Also, try to choose v such that f(x, y, z, p, q) in the given eqn can be easily expressed in u, v
                        3. Choose v as simple as possible
                        4. If f(x, y, z, p, q) is symmetric in x, y then choose v such that it is symmetric to u.
                        5. else if given eqn is asymmetric in x or y then choose v such that asymmetric terms gets cancelled.
                Case 3: if the roots are imaginary
                    Here choose u, v same as in case 1.
                    Say u = α + iβ
                    Therefore v = α - iβ
                    instead of choosing u, v as new independent variables, here we choose α, β as new independent variables.
                After choosing independent variables, convert the given eqn into new independent varibles.
                The eqn will be changed to canonical form which can be solved using Direct Integration.
